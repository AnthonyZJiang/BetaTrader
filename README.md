# Introduction
This is a chaotic collection of my failed attempt of auto stock trading developments. The current use of this collection is now resolved to a trading simulator using IBKR TWS API.

To use the simulator, you will need an IBKR account with Real time stock data.

# Dependencies
python >= 3.18

# Installation
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Use
```
./run_sim.py
```
